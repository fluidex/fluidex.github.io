It <a href=\"/en/blog/zkrollup-intro1/\">can save the cost of each transaction to 1/100</a> while still offering the same security level as layer 1.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<h3>Uncompromising security</h3>\n<p>Fluidex uses Zero-knowledge Proof schemes so that users don’t need to trust the exchange being ethical, the Math/Cryptography behind it can guarantee that users’ funds always stay “SAFU”. The exchange has no way to steal users’ funds or creat unauthorized orders. Even in the worst case that the exchange shuts down, users can still withdraw their funds safely.</p>\n<h3>Trading without latency</h3>\n<p>In a DEX on layer 1, users need to interact with smart contracts and a trade is viewed valid only after it’s included in a block and submitted on chain. However, FluiDex offers a CEX-ish trading experince and can process users’ orders immediately. Users don’t need to wait to know whether a trade succeed or not.</p>\n<h3>Lower costs</h3>\n<p>ZK-Rollup compresses transaction data so as to have lower average gas fee. User don’t need to pay high transaction fee as on layer 1, which is quite friendly to retail users and frequent traders.</p>\n<h3>Professional trading experience</h3>\n<p>FluiDex is a orderbook AMM-hybrid DEX. A retail user may choose to trade through orderbook webpage or AMM webpage. A quant trader / market maker / Liquidity Provider (LP) may choose to monitor the tickers and place/cancel orders via APIs. FluiDex provides professional trading experience, for example it supports limit / market / post-only / IOC / stoploss… order types, and market maker can gain rebates.</p>\n<h3>Flexible and efficient AMM algorithm</h3>\n<p>FluiDex uses the <a href=\"/en/blog/damm/\">Differential AMM</a> we propose, which can noticeably increase the capital efficiency and optimize orderbook depth, can can support both orderbook and AMM seamlessly. FluiDex team itself can also brigde external liquidity from other DEXs/CEXs, to offer better liquidity.</p>\n<h3>Permissionless listing</h3>\n<p>Anyone can list a ERC20 token on FluiDex permissionlessly. And a project team can adjust liquidity distribution by AMM parameters, for\nautomated market making (AMM) or initial DEX offering (IDO).</p>\n<h2>Co-founders</h2>\n<p>CEO: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/zhuo-zhang-75340152/\">Zhuo ZHANG</a>.
