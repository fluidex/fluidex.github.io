This could mean huge for supporting multiple platforms while remaining efficient. Nevertheless, we can compile C/C++/Java/Rust/GoLang, and etc., into WASM, and therefore reduce the learning curve.</p>\n<p>But this is just an ideal case. In fact, when it comes to Cryptography, there are some more factors needed to be taken into considerations. </p>\n<p>In modern CPUs, there are many optimizations for Cryptography, but they cannot be utilized inside WASM VMs. Usually running SNARKs inside WASM VMs will be several times slower than on a native CPU.</p>\n<p>Moreover, there are a couple of other limitations when using WASM:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It doesn’t support multi-thread parallelism.</li>\n<li>Memory is limited. Usually you only have 1~4 G available (If you encounter <code class=\"language-text\">[CompileError: WebAssembly.compile(): data segments count of 104626 exceeds internal limit of 100000</code> when using <a href=\"https://github.com/iden3/circom/tree/master/ports/wasm\">circom wasm port</a> to compile a large circuit, it’s out of this reason). Otherwise you will have to compile your own WASM by yourself, like in <a href=\"https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/8755#issuecomment-499682033\">here</a>. But again, this brings inconvenience for other contributors/developers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When we develop large circuits using <a href=\"https://github.com/iden3/circom/tree/master/ports/wasm\">circom wasm port</a> 和 <a href=\"https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs\">snarkjs</a> we often encounter error messages like <code class=\"language-text\">data segments count exceeds internal limit</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">insufficient memory</code>, which bother our developments (the latter problem is not caused by WASM, but <code class=\"language-text\">node.js</code> default configurations though). It’s true that we can use <a href=\"https://github.com/iden3/circom/tree/master/ports/c\">circom c port</a> to solve this kind of problems. But there is no good wrapper existed, we would have to write a script to make use of <a href=\"https://github.com/iden3/circom/tree/master/ports/c\">circom c port</a> to compile the circuit and generate the witness. This may not be convenient for other developers who do not have this script.</p>\n<p>Due to the reasons mentioned above, we decide to develop and open-source <a href=\"https://github.com/Fluidex/snarkit\">https://github.com/Fluidex/snarkit</a>. It’s a wrapper for <a href=\"https://github.com/iden3/circom/tree/master/ports/c\">circom c port</a>, but it also adds better error detection. With <a href=\"https://github.com/Fluidex/snarkit\">https://github.com/Fluidex/snarkit</a>, people can use <a href=\"https://github.com/iden3/circom\">circom</a> to develop large circuits, the witness generation speed can also be boosted up. We believe this can make <a href=\"https://github.com/iden3/circom\">circom</a> circuit developments more friendly, and thus benefit zk-SNARKs ecosystem. </p>\n<p>We hope you all enjoy using it!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The inconveniences in developing Cryptography using WASM, and the motivation of snarkit","tags":["technical"],"date":"2021-04-17T00:00:00.000Z","description":null}},"prev":{"frontmatter":{"title":"ZK-Rollup development experience sharing, Part I"},"fields":{"slug":"/en/blog/zkrollup-intro1/"}},"next":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Fluidex Recent Updates"},"fields":{"slug":"/en/blog/2021-03-03-updates/"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/en/blog/the-motivation-of-snarkit/","prevSlug":"/en/blog/zkrollup-intro1/","nextSlug":"/en/blog/2021-03-03-updates/","langKey":"en"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2555585279","2841359383","3159585216"]}
